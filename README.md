# Solving Convex Hull with Graham's Scan and representing in OpenGL
  
    Implementation of Graham's Scan for solving Convex Hull problem in C++ .
    The Solution and the graph is plotted using OpenGL. It was coded in CodeBlocks.
    
  In the CODE :
  
  Line 140 :  The variable "scale"  scales the graph represented in the openGL window.
  
  Line 307 :  Name of the file which contains the graph.
